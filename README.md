# ZPE-NG
A C++ implementation of the Zenith Parsing Engine and some of the ZPE Programming Environment. This was originally called ZPE-NG but the effort couldn't parallel the original.

This implementation was written primarily in C++ with a bit of assembly language for better performance than the Java version, but was later decided that it couldn't keep up with the Java version.
